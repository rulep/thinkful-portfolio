    <!-- About Me -->

      <article>
        <h2>So, about me.</h2> 
        
          <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer based in Alaska. As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" class="thinkful-link" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, I also work as a Case Manager for the Courts.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I come from a non-technical background having studied Computerized Accounting. I took up Web Development as a hobby. During my studies, I came across Thinkful, where I learned more about the program. As my interests aligned with it's offerings, I signed on to take this hobby to the next level.</li>
          <li>To balance my studies and work life, I spend time with family and friends in a    variety of activities, including taking    in the outdoors and all that Alaska has  to offer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I'm always looking for new friends to build cool things.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in working on a project together, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
